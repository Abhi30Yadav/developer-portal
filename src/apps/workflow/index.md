## Workflow capabilities

What business operations does the workflow support?

Shopware offers Flow Builder as an automation solution to automate business processes. One can:

*	[Build Actions]((/docs/guides/plugins/apps/flow-builder/add-custom-flow-actions-from-app-system) - Workflow triggers are events that cause a workflow to run. Hence, to create automation, you need to build a workflow using components called triggers, conditions, and actions.

*	[Create Webhooks](/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide#webhooks) - You can send data about events on the server to a web application using webhooks. This is to say that apps offer the possibility to deliver their own flow actions via webhooks. With webhooks, you can subscribe to events occurring in Shopware.

*	[Generate documents](/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/checkout/document/add-custom-document-type#adding-a-generator) - Document generation automatically creates typical documents used within a business, such as invoices, contracts, order cancellations, and more. These document templates can be customized to have different brand names or personalized marketing messages on invoice templates with a PDF generator. 

*	[Define Rule builder](/docs/guides/plugins/apps/rule-builder) â€“ Allows users to create and manage workflow rules or business events without the need for programming skills. Rule builders typically provide a visual interface or drag-and-drop functionality that makes it easy for users to define the conditions and actions that should be triggered as part of a workflow process.
