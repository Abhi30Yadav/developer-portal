# Storefront Overview

Storefront (frontend) is a key component of every ecommerce business, serving as the primary interface for online customers to view products, place orders, manage their purchases, etc. A well-designed frontend can create an engaging user experience, ultimately leading to increased customer satisfaction and higher sales.

Shopware offers developers tools and flexibility to create highly customizable, user-friendly storefronts that seamlessly integrate with their backend systems and cater to their ecommerce business's unique needs.

## Storefront behavior

Shopware's Storefront is well structured and predominantly consists of [design templates](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/storefront#custom-template-priority) that match your brand and store themes. So if you are looking at custom design templates, custom styling, etc., that can modify the whole appearance of your store, then take a look at our [Guide on Storefront](/docs/guides/plugins/apps/storefront).

* Search products
